1. Grade Checker
Take a score as input and print the grade based on the following:
90+ : "A"
80-89 : "B"
70-79 : "C"
60-69 : "D"
Below 60 : "F"
here we used a basic if else statement to carry out marks and all.
Solution:- 
def calculate_grade(score):
  if score >= 90:
    return "A"
  elif score >= 80:
    return "B"
  elif score >= 70:
    return "C"
  elif score >= 60:
    return "D"
  else:
    return "F"

# Get input from the user
try:
  score = float(input("Enter the score: "))
  
  # Validate the score is within a typical range (optional but good practice)
  if 0 <= score <= 100:
    grade = calculate_grade(score)
    print(f"The grade is: {grade}")
  else:
    print("Please enter a score between 0 and 100.")
except ValueError:
  print("Invalid input. Please enter a number.")
Question 2
2 Student Grades
Create a dictionary where the keys are student names and the values are their grades. Allow the user to:
Add a new student and grade.
Update an existing student’s grade.
Print all student grades
Solution:- 
def manage_student_grades():
    """
    Manages student grades using a dictionary, allowing adding, updating,
    and printing grades.
    """
    student_grades = {}

    while True:
        print("\n--- Student Grade Management ---")
        print("1. Add new student and grade")
        print("2. Update existing student's grade")
        print("3. Print all student grades")
        print("4. Exit")

        choice = input("Enter your choice (1-4): ")

        if choice == '1':
            name = input("Enter student name: ")
            try:
                grade = float(input(f"Enter grade for {name}: "))
                student_grades[name] = grade
                print(f"Grade for {name} added successfully.")
            except ValueError:
                print("Invalid grade. Please enter a numeric value.")
        elif choice == '2':
            name = input("Enter student name to update: ")
            if name in student_grades:
                try:
                    new_grade = float(input(f"Enter new grade for {name}: "))
                    student_grades[name] = new_grade
                    print(f"Grade for {name} updated successfully.")
                except ValueError:
                    print("Invalid grade. Please enter a numeric value.")
            else:
                print(f"Student '{name}' not found.")
        elif choice == '3':
            if student_grades:
                print("\n--- All Student Grades ---")
                for name, grade in student_grades.items():
                    print(f"{name}: {grade}")
            else:
                print("No student grades to display.")
        elif choice == '4':
            print("Exiting program. Goodbye!")
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Please enter a number between 1 and 4.")

Question 3 -> 
3.Write to a File
Write a program to create a text file and write some content to it.

Using file functions like write and open
Solution-> 
# Define the filename
filename = "my_new_file.txt"

# Content to write to the file
content_to_write = "Hello, this is the first line.\n" \
                   "This is the second line of content.\n" \
                   "And this is the final line."

# Open the file in write mode ('w') using a 'with' statement
# The 'with' statement ensures the file is automatically closed,
# even if errors occur.
try:
    with open(filename, 'w') as file_object:
        # Write the content to the file
        file_object.write(content_to_write)
    print(f"Content successfully written to '{filename}'")

except IOError as e:
    print(f"An error occurred while writing to the file: {e}")
Question 4-> 4. Read from a File
We used open in read mode and file.read to read and print to display.
Solution-> 
  # Create a dummy file for demonstration
with open("sample.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write("This is a sample line.\n")
    f.write("This is another line.")

# Open the file in read mode
file_object = open("sample.txt", "r")

# Read the entire content of the file
file_content = file_object.read()

# Print the content
print(file_content)

# Close the file
file_object.close()
